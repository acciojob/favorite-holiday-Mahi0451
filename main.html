	<h1>Goa</h1><br>
	<p>A place full of beaches and coconut trees all around. It is a state in western India with coastlines stretching along the Arabian Sea. Its long history as a Portuguese colony prior to 1961 is evident in its preserved 17th-century churches and the areaâ€™s tropical spice plantations. Goa is also known for its beaches, ranging from popular stretches at Baga and Palolem to those in laid-back fishing villages such as Agonda. Lots of clubs where we can enjoy.</p>
